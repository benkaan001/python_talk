'''
Given a permutation of first n natural numbers as array and an integer k. 
Print the lexicographically largest permutation after at most k swaps 

Input: arr[] = {4, 5, 2, 1, 3}
       k = 3
Output: 5 4 3 2 1
Swap 1st and 2nd elements: 5 4 2 1 3 
Swap 3rd and 5th elements: 5 4 3 1 2 
Swap 4th and 5th elements: 5 4 3 2 1 

Input: arr[] = {2, 1, 3} k = 1
Output: 3 1 2
Swap 1st and 3re elements: 3 1 2
