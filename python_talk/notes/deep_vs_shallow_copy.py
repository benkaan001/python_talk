'''

Built-in mutable collections like list,dict, set can be copied by
calling their factory functions on an existing collection:

    new_dict = dict(original_dict)

...


A shallow copy means constructing a new collection object and then populating it 
with references to the child objects found in the original.
    A shallow copy is only one level deep. 
    The copying process does not recurse and 
    therefore wonâ€™t create copies of the child objects themselves.

A deep copy makes the copying process recursive. 
It first constructs a new collection object and then recursively 
populates it with copies of the child objects found in the original. 
    Deep copy walks the whole object tree to create a fully independent clone of 
    the original object and all of its children.

# create a shallow copy

"""Confirm that shallow copy is a new and independent object"""

"""
Even though shallow_copy is an independent object, it still has reference to the child objects
stored in the original_list. 
Modifying one of the child objects in original list will be reflected in the shallow copy as well
